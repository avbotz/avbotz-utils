Pixpik:
	Run pixpic IMAGE_NAME > OUTPUT
	IMAGE_NAME can have a wildcard

Filter:
	Run filter < INPUT > OUTPUT
	Removes duplicate pixels

Locpick:
	Run "java -jar LocPick.jar [dir name] [file name]" in a terminal (I think windows works w/ cmd)
	The [dir name] is the folder that has all of the images you are picking from.
	The [file name] is the file you are writing to, e.g. "torpedo.txt"
	An example command would be "java -jar LocPick.jar torpedoImages torpedo.txt"
